# Torpedo Team Meeting 30/08/2022

> Attendence: Sheon, Ya, Deon, Avanish, Phillip

## Avanish

- Measurements of noise contributions
  - Low frequency
  - Instrument noise using SR785
  - ADC module noise and dark noise from photo detector using Moku (beatnote frequency)
- This week: more measurements, and plan to test with Moku normal and precision modes

## Phillip

- Moku API data streaming caused a flat line when value's around 0
  - The signals are 0.5Hz from waveform generator into Moku Lab
  - The amplitude (peak to peak is 40mV for ramp to 80mV for sine wave)
  - Possible reasons: Moku downsampling issues; signal amplitude too low;
- This week: try test with higher amplitude and higher frequency signals; talk with Paul on Thursday

## Deon

- Progress on utilizing waterjet from Makerspace with Sheon in cutting panels. Had some issues with drawing to be used in the waterjet machine (the holes are 1mm smaller).
  - More familiar with waterjet machine to cut aluminum panels so can make panels quickly in the future
- This week update the drawing and test it with a new panel to cut.

## Ya

- Laser workstation setup update (including zig-zag layout for optical; consider using separate two mirrors)
- Plan to reduce noise by using a 2nd sensor and a folding mirror
  - Mount with 2mm aluminum
- Contact NI for FPGA training for CGA, have got positive feedback and free courses and FPGA equipment is possible fro academic purposes.

## Sheon

- Finished plugging in LVDT (Linear variable differential transformer) which is powered separately from other parts, plan to turn them on.
- 4-channel ADC card for laser frequency measurements for Avanish.
- Orders from digikey, thorlabs are on the way.
